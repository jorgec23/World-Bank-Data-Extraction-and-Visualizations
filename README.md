# World-Bank-Data-Extraction-and-Visualizations

# These scripts and functions represent my Capstone Project for the Python for Everybody Specialization

# I began by first defining a normalized database structure that would store all of the data.  
# For data, I decided to limit my analysis to 5 categories: Employment, Education, Income, Economy, and Population.
# Within each category, there are a set of indicators, such as 'SP.POP.TOTL', that represent some statistic for a country 
# from the years 1960 to 1919.
# For tables, I created the following:
#   - countries: stored every country name with its corresponding country letter codes, region id, income level id and primary id
#   - indicators: indicator code, indicator name, indicator id
#   - region: region name, region id
#   - income level: income level designation, income level id
#   - AllData: stores all of the indicator values for each country, from 1960 to 2019.  It contains the country id, indicator id,
#              indicator value, date, and a primary key
